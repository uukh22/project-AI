## Solve N-Queens by Genetic Algorithm

### Overview
TThe N-Queens problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other.

### Features

1. **Genetic Algorithm :**
   - Utilizes a genetic algorithm to search for solutions to the N-Queens problem.

2. **Fitness Function :**
   - Calculates the fitness of each chromosome (solution candidate) based on the number of conflicts (horizontal and diagonal) between queens.

3. **Mutation and Crossover :**
   -Implements mutation and crossover operations to evolve the population of solutions over generations.
   
5. **Visualization :**
   - Generates images of the chessboard with queens placed for each generation and combines them into an animated GIF.

6. **Customizable :**
   - Allows users to specify the number of queens and population size.
